Marvel Brawl 


This is my third project that I created while attending the Flatiron School.
My partner and I intended to create a card game using the Marvel API where a user will be able to assemble their own teams of superheroes
to go against a team of super villains randomly selected by the computer.

Unfortunately the Marvel API did not allow for this because they do not give us any stat info for the characters.

My partner worked on the backend of this project using ruby on rails and I worked on the front end using react, javascript and CSS.

Upon Page load you will see a stack of cards.
- Once clicked these cards will spread out.

On the left had side is a slide-out bar
- When slid out you can drag and drop characters that you want to join your team onto the white boxes.
  - Only 1 card per box
  - You cannot choose the same card twice

You click the remove button to remove the card.

In the main container you can also flip the card to see the character description etc.
  - Every Comic book background is unique to each character. It is the first comic book the character has ever appeared in and is also being pulled directly from the Marvel API.
